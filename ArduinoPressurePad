// fill it in with pressure dependent speed! think about what intervals you would want and how much you would want the speed to change by for each interval. 
// notes: analogRead(pressure) will get you the value from the pressure pad from 0-1023 that tells you how hard it is being clicked 
//  - if the value is 0, the pressure pad is not being pressed at all. Be sure to account for a small error due to the sensitivity of the pressure pad (ex. if it reads a value slightly over 0 like 10, it's probably not being pressed intentionally)
//  - stepper.setSpeed(x); - will set the speed to the value of x. the range of speeds is from 0-600. it can technically be negative too, but don't worry about that quite yet. 
//           --> something to think about: what WOULD happen if you set the speed to a negative value?
//  - stepper.runSpeed();  - will run the motor at the speed you set previously.
